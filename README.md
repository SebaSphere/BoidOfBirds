# Overview
This game is a simulation inspired by the Boids algorithm, where entities (resembling birds or other creatures) follow simple rules to create emergent, lifelike behavior.

New entities spawn into the simulation every 10 seconds, adding dynamic variety to the ecosystem.

Your goal is to avoid these entities as the player as long as possible.

This repository was done as a group project for COP2800, Java Programming, at Miami Dade College using Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

# How to Play
