# Overview
This game is a simulation inspired by the Boids algorithm, where entities (resembling birds or other creatures) follow simple rules to create emergent, lifelike behavior.

New entities spawn into the simulation every 10 seconds, adding dynamic variety to the ecosystem.

This repository was done as a group project for COP2800, Java Programming at Miami Dade College using Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
